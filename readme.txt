The ThemeBright slider.

== Description ==

This is the official ThemeBright slider that powers all the ThemeBright themes. If you've purchased a theme from ThemeBright.co that has a slider, you need this plugin to make it work.

== Installation ==

Upload and activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin with non-ThemeBright themes? =
If you've got development chops, you shouldn't find it too difficult to integrate this with your own theme. But for those wanting a plug-n-play solution, you best look for another option.
